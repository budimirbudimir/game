This is essentially my first attempt to build a 3D WebGL game, or any game in general. It's possible it'll be buggy, but what I hope for is that it'll be fun as well!

## Project structure

- `/app` - Holds Redux store specifics
- `/components` - Holds any reusable UI components

- `/models` - Holds any reusable 3D components
- `/utils` - Helper functions and constants

## External dependencies
